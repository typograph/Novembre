Last Thing Not Done

- Incorporate plane subtraction/leveling into the browser.
- Reimplement specpoint showing  (Done in 0.0.5d)

Release NVBBrowser

- Compile documentation
- Document every undocumented feature

- Remove all FIXME comments, implementing the missing functionality

- NVBPageInfoWidget
	- Needs reasonable interface for showing important and unimportant params
	- Has to show extra info, not available as comments

- NVBAxisSelector
	+ Optimize name / index queries
	- Optimize instantiateOneXXX functions and NVBSelectorDataInstance::instantiate
	+ Write unit tests for all of the features.
	- allow negating rules
	- general DataSource matching (dataset-free, like all maps over 2 axes?)
	- Extend buddy mechanism (current syntax should work)
		- case one more axis with SL, one with SUL (independent features)
		- case -UL-LM-MU- (ring dependence - multiple parents) [Rules are ordered, i.e. one could just use the rule index]
		- case shorter/longer
		- FLAGS for buddy
	? QRegExp for name matching
	
Polishing NVBBrowser

- Beautify NVBSingleView
	- rounded corners // Seems impossible
	+ white background
	- animation on show and hide
	+ reasonable hide behaviour

- Subclass for 2D plane showing
	+ show arbitrary data
	? use QwtPlot and QwtSpectrogram
	- show color bar
	- make the colorbar interactive - wheel to scale, drag to shift
	- support uneven x/y axes
	- support angles
	- color autoscale selectable

- NVBFileBundle
	- In-browser creation
	- check loading

- WinSPM support
- Omicron support

- Extend filters
	- "Less than"/"More than"
	- "In set"

Finishing NVBMain

- Subclass NVBCoreApplication for NVBMainApplication

- Structurize data filter tree signals & slots

- improve NVBUnits
	- support for compound units (e.g. m/s)
		- support for multiplying/dividing NVBPhysValue
	- support for non-decimal units (hours and degrees)
	+ support for common multiletter units, e.g. Hertz, Gauss, Lumen etc.
